## jsperf.app

This is a complete re-write in homage to the once excellent jsperf.com.

Most jsperf.com URLs / tests are mirrored at the same path, e.g:

https://jsperf.com/last-element-of-array-xxx/2

Can be accessed at:

https://jsperf.app/last-element-of-array-xxx/2

This was written as a labor of love and my want for the familiarity of jsperf again - now with proper code sandboxing and a more modern maintainable codebase with NextJS including SSR Server-Side Rendering and ISR Incremental Static Regeneration.
